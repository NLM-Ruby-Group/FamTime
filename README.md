## Q&A
- What are some examples of places to add to our website?
 > Places can be: parks, recreational centers, library, sports field.

- What are some examples of events?
 > Events can be: picnics, music/drawing classes, sports games and many more.

- Are there enough places to keep the app interesting after a long time?
 > Yes, we may not know a lot of places but the users will contribute to the contents. Eventually if all the interesting places for families have been added to the website, the users can still interact by creating events. Users here can be parents themselves, event host, shop/classes owners.

How to prevent people from adding fake places
 > Before adding a place to our list the users will have to provide details such as photos, address, name to be sure that the place exist before being allowed to post.

- How to keep the quality of our list
 > If a place is not safe, is too dirty or generally not suitable for kids, parents can comment and review it. In extreme cases they can report and after a certain amount of bad reports the place will be removed from our list AND/OR added to a blacklist, similar to our suggested places but used to show where kids should not go

- Are events safe or parents can get scammed?
 > We will add a phone verification prior to the creation of events. Only the verified users will be allowed to create events and the eventual payment of a ticket will be made face to face. 

- Any method to make sure one user only has one single account? Do we need a assetment system to evaluate credit point of user?
